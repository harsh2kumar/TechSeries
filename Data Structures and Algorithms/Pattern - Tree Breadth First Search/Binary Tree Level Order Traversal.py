# Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right
# in separate sub-arrays.

# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/solution/
# Time Complexity The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree.
# This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
# Space Complexity The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal.
# We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level),
# therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
