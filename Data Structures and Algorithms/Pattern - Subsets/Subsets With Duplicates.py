# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/solution/
# Time Complexity Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets,
# where â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the
# above algorithm will be O(N*2^N).
# Space Complexity All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take
# up to O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N).
