# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
# Grokking
# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/solution/
# Time Complexity O(MÃ—N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
# Space Complexity O(min(M,N)) because in worst case where the grid is filled with lands, the size of queue can grow up to min(M,N).
