# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/solution/
# Time Complexity The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of meetings.
# This is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. Also, while iterating the meetings we might need to poll/offer meeting to the priority queue.
# Each of these operations can take O(logN). Overall our algorithm will take O(NlogN).
# Space Complexity The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting.
# Also, in the worst case scenario, we’ll have to insert all the meetings into the Min Heap (when all meetings overlap) which will also take O(N) space.
# The overall space complexity of our algorithm is O(N).
