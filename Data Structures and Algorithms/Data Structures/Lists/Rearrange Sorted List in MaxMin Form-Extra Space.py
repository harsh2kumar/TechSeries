# Implement a function called max_min(lst) which will re-arrange the elements of a sorted list such that the 0th index will have the largest number,
# the 1st index will have the smallest, and the 2nd index will have second-largest, and so on. In other words, all the even-numbered indices will have the
# largest numbers in the list in descending order and the odd-numbered indices will have the smallest numbers in ascending order.

# Solution
# Time Complexity Since this algorithm only traverses over the list once, itâ€™s in linear time, O(n).
# Space Complexity The space complexity is O(N).

# using O(N) space
