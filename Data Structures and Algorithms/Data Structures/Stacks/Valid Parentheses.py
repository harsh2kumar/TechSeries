# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/solution/
# Time Complexity Since this algorithm only traverses over the string once, itâ€™s in linear time, O(n).
# Space Complexity The space complexity is O(n) because we can store all characters in our stack.
