# The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.
# You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
# For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2.
# If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.
# Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

# Time Complexity Since this algorithm only traverses over the list once, itâ€™s in linear time, O(n).
# Space Complexity The space complexity is O(n) because we store all elements in our map.
