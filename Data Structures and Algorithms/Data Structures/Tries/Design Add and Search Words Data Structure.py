# Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.
# Grokking
# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/aolution/
# Time Complexity O(M) for the "well-defined" words without dots, where MM is the key length, and NN is a number of keys, and O(Nâ‹…26^M) for the "undefined" words.
# That corresponds to the worst-case situation of searching an undefined word which is one character longer than all inserted keys.
# Space Complexity O(1) for the search of "well-defined" words without dots, and up to O(M) for the "undefined" words, to keep the recursion stack.
