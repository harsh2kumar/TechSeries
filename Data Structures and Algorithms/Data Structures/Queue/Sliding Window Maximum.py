# You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
# You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/solution/
# Time Complexity O(N), since each element is processed exactly twice - it's index added and then removed from the deque.
# Space Complexity O(N), since O(Nâˆ’k+1) is used for an output array and O(k) for a deque.
