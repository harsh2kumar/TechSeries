# Given a binary tree, write an iterative algorithm to traverse the tree in-order. Letâ€™s look at the tree below as an example.

# Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/
# Solution https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/solution/
# Time Complexity The runtime complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).
# Space Complexity The space complexity of this solution is O(h). An iterative solution has O(h) memory complexity as it instantiates a stack
# that has to store information up to the height of the binary tree (h). It will be O(logn) for a balanced tree and, in the worst case, can be O(n).
