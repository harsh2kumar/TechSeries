# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a boolean indicating whether it is possible to choose numbers that
# sum to target. The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.
# Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
# It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
