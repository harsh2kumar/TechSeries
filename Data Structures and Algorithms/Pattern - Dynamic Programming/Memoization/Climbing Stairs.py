# Time Complexity The time complexity of the above algorithm isÂ O(n).
# Space Complexity The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1).


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # base case
        # if we are on last stair, then there is 1 way to reach the destination, by not moving at all
        # if we are on the second-last stair, then there is 1 way to reach the destination, by taking one step and reaching the last stair
        one, two = 1, 1
        # everytime, we just compute the results by adding results from the next 2 steps
        for _ in range(n-1):
            temp = one
            one = one+two
            two = temp
        # return the answer
        return one
